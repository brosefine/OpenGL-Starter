# OpenGL Start Example

Small OpenGL Hello Triangle Example using some basic classes for textures, meshes, camera, etc.

## Setup

### Dependencies
Hopefully, all dependencies should be loaded automatically by the CMakeLists.txt in thirdparty/. If successfull, they will be in [build-folder]/deps_.
- glm
- glad
- glfw
- imgui
- stb_image (included in thirdparty/)

### Windows
- open directory in CMake GUI
- select VS 2019
- Configure & Generate
- Open Project to open solution in VS

### Linux (TODO)

## Controls (if using camera)
- WASD: move camera
- SHIFT: move faster
- Mouse move & right mouse click: rotate camera

## Sources
### Images and Textures
- Example texture generated with [space-3d](https://wwwtyro.github.io/space-3d/#animationSpeed=1&fov=80&nebulae=true&pointStars=true&resolution=1024&seed=3wq0xhr2fwu8&stars=true&sun=false) by Rye Terrell
